# NeuVector

NeuVector Full Lifecycle Container Security Platform delivers the only cloud-native security with uncompromising end-to-end protection from DevOps vulnerability protection to automated run-time security, and featuring a true Layer 7 container firewall.

A viewable version of docs can be seen at https://open-docs.neuvector.com.

The container images for the preview version can be pulled from the NeuVector Docker Hub registry at:
+ neuvector/manager.preview:5.0.0-preview.3
+ neuvector/controller.preview:5.0.0-preview.3
+ neuvector/enforcer.preview:5.0.0-preview.3
+ neuvector/scanner.preview:latest
+ neuvector/updater.preview:latest

If deploying with the current NeuVector Helm chart (v1.8.9+), the following changes should be made to values.yml:

+ Update the registry to docker.io
+ Update image names/tags to the preview version on Docker hub, as shown above
+ Leave the imagePullSecrets empty
